        This specification describes data structures for card-based payments
        using WebIDL. It is used by other specifications to facilitate monetary
        transactions with "basic cards", such as credit and debit cards.

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification is a Payment Method specification for use, for
        instance, with the <cite data-cite="payment-request">PaymentRequest
        API</cite>. With it, merchants can collect the basic card details (card
        holder name, card number, etc.) as an alternative to collecting the
        same information through a HTML form.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The Web Payments Working Group is also investigating payment methods
        that offer greater security (e.g., through tokenization).

          The <a>supportedNetworks</a> member contains a sequence of
          identifiers for card networks that the merchant accepts. W3C
          maintains a <a href=

          The <a>supportedTypes</a> member contains a sequence of card types
          that the merchant accepts. Implementations will determine how to
          match the type values <span data-link-for=

          <a>prepaid</a></span>.

      <p class="note">
        The <a>supportedNetworks</a> and <a>supportedTypes</a> members are both
        optional. If neither is provided then any card may be returned. If only
        <a>supportedNetworks</a> is provided then any card type may be returned
        provided it matches one of the networks. If only <a>supportedTypes</a>
        is provided then a card may be returned from any network provided it
        matches one of the types.

        Security and Privacy Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Owners of web sites SHOULD NOT store the payer's card information
        except where warranted, such as storage for future and recurring
        payments. When card information is stored, web site owners SHOULD take
        measures to prevent its disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: Implementers may be subject to PCI DSS or other
        regulations, but discussion of those considerations lies outside the
        scope of this document.
